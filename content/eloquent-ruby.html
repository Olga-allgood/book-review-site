                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                It’s easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code,
                you must go beyond syntax and absorb the Ruby way of thinking and problem solving.
                In <em>Eloquent Ruby</em>, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do so you can
                leverage its immense, surprising power...
                </p>
                <p>
                Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and teaching Ruby to other programmers.
                He guides you to the “Ah Ha!” moments when it suddenly becomes clear why Ruby works the way it does,
                and how you can take advantage of this language’s elegance and expressiveness.
                </p>
                <p>
                The book concludes with project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain-Specific Languages.
                A part of the renowned Addison-Wesley Professional Ruby Series, <em>Eloquent Ruby</em> will help you
                put on your Ruby-colored glasses and get results that make you a true believer.

                <h3>Reviews</h3>
                <h4>Review #1: The first Ruby book I read in full within 24 hours</h4>
                <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Peter Cooper</p>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 26, 2011</p>
                This book is so easy to read yet so useful and informative that I read it in its entirety within 24 hours...
                
                Eloquent Ruby is a book published by Addison Wesley and written by Russ Olsen (who also wrote
                Design Patterns in Ruby). It clocks in at around 400 pages and has 31 punchy chapters...
                </p>
                <p>
                I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone except those who, well, could have written a similar book
                themselves... This book is a must-read if you're not confident with Ruby idioms and the best way to
                structure and lay out your code.

                <h4>Review #2: Eloquent Olsen</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Fogus</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 7, 2011</p>

                <p>
                    For better or worse the vast majority of my work life journey has been travelled with Java...
                    However, I absolutely loved Design Patterns in Ruby for reasons I was not expecting.
                    I found an extremely interesting book that was playful, and as a nice side-effect,
                    actually taught me how Ruby's powerful features make many design patterns unnecessary.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Olsen, with his latest effort, has mastered the art of writing a book that is extremely interesting,
                    fun, and informative. "Eloquent Ruby" is written for the programmer with prior experience but little Ruby knowledge.
                    It guides readers through the Ruby mindset and demonstrates how its features work together to foster elegance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russ Olsen has helped me gain more experience points in Ruby, and I must say that I am excited to learn more.
                    If you too wish to learn Ruby, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better book than Eloquent Ruby.
